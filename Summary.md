This was a mini project conducted during the web development course at FDM group. 
The course was a week long with the aim of producing a working blogging platform.

The requirements of this project were:

  Registered users should be able to view blogs and comments on them as well as add their own blog content. 
  Owners should be able to track comments/likes/dislikes against an average level for their blog.
  User should be able to serach for a blog based on topic, name of blog or blog ownder using free text search.
  Registered users should be able to spend "likes" from a credit balance already added to their account.
  Users can earn "likes" to spend on other people by accumalating "likes" themselves.
  
However, databases were not permitted and thus a lot of functionality was lost.
