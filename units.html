									Ever since his father rescued him from a rampaging beast in the forest as a young child, Vargas was determined to become a knight.
									He never forgot the silhouette of his father's back, standing undaunted before the magnificent beast.
									Quickly becoming reknowned for his skill with a blade, some speculate that if he had only chosen to remain with the knights,
									he would have risen to their top ranks, and young knights would have been inspired by the dauntless silhouette of his own back.

									Unwilling to sacrifice her freedom to anyone, Selena once ran away at the age of 17.
									Her escape is thought to have come to an end just as she was about to leave the kingdon, at the habour where her friend Lucina waited.
									Nobody can say that words the girls exchanged, but ig the Six Heroes had succeeded in driving back the invading God Army, perhaps
									the two friends would have set upon a voyage across the Grand Gaian seas in search of Lucina's parents.

									After he freed the Earth Tree, what became of Lance is unknown, save some reports that he left a letter for his family.
									Anecdotes vary, but the letter is thought to have firstly said that he would likely not return, and cryptically, that if he was able to
									truly save a certain friend, he would like to return together. If the Six Heroes had been successful in repelling the God's invasion,
									perhaps Lance would have broken the curse that afflicted his friend, and then founded a line of valiant knights together.
									Whatever the case, it's hard to imagine him ever giving up on the bonds of friendship.

									There are countless records of Eze's prowess in battle, but few touch on the subject of his suitability as a leader.
									Of these scant materials, the overwhelming majority are skeptical, to say the least.
									Only Weiss is quoted as vouching for Eze, "A leader doesn't need to think, if they can sense danger and quickly take action that
									will inspire their followers." If the Six Heroes had succeeded in repelling the Gods, perhaps we would have witnessed the unlikely sight
									of Eze parading alongside respected generals and tacticians.

									If the Six Heroes had succeeded in repelling the gods, perhaps Atro, like the teacher he so revered, would have set out on his own 
									sojourn, traveling the lands and teaching others his unique style of swordsmanship. 
									Always more concerned about the futures of children than of himself, it's likely he would have inspired many children to become 
									practitioners not only of his school of swordplay, but also his ideology and ethics. 
									It's not difficult to imagine the name of "Holy Knight Atro" being handed down from generation to generation.

									Magress lived only for revenge, but ultimately died a knight's valiant death in battle.
									His own revenge was left unfulfilled.
									Although, historians wonder, had he achieved his ultimate revenge, would the spell of vengeance actually have been broken?
									Even if the Six Heroes had rallied to repel the Gods, could he have ever stopped fighting?
									According to a friend of Magress, "He was a man best described as one with madness lurking within the shadows of mercy."
									We can only wonder what fate awaited when he freed his true self and manifested as a God of Destruction.
